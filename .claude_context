# Claude Code Context File

## Project Type
Real Estate Application - Luxury Property Platform for Cartagena, Colombia

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + React Router + Context API
- Backend: Dual architecture (Flask + Node.js Express)
- Database: SQLite (2 separate databases)
- Authentication: Google OAuth + JWT
- UI: Custom CSS + Swiper.js carousel

## Code Style Rules
- NO EMOJIS in any code files, comments, or documentation
- Use descriptive variable names
- Follow existing code patterns
- Modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Python PEP 8 for Flask backend

## Key Architecture Notes
- Port conflict: Both backends on port 5000 (needs resolution)
- Flask handles auth/admin, Node.js handles property operations
- Two separate SQLite databases need synchronization
- Frontend integrates with both backend APIs

## Current Development State
- Property likes system recently added
- Hottest properties carousel implemented
- Admin dashboard functional
- Google OAuth working
- Booking system operational
- Luxury Cartagena properties seeded

## Critical Issues to Address
1. Backend port conflict resolution
2. Database schema unification
3. API integration consistency

## Recent File Additions
- HottestPropertiesCarousel component
- LikeButton and LikeContext
- LikedPropertiesPage
- Comprehensive property seeding data
